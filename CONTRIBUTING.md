This doc is a Work in Progress, but here are the basics.

## Getting Started

This project follows the Git Flow branching process. [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-flow) has a good overview and will serve as the basis for how we branch this project for the time being.

This project uses [Volta](https://volta.sh/) to ensure that everyone developing in this project has the same tools installed.

This project uses [NPM Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) to organize individual packages.

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure consistent formatting of all files within this project.

TODO: this project will use commit naming conventions defined by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), we need to write up a more comprehensive guide on the commit naming should follow your feature branch naming as well.
